##finding optimal no. of clusters https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/determining-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-3-must-know-methods/

##clusters: frequency is calculated out of mean value of days from prior sale

library(dplyr)

user_freq <- orders %>%
    select(user_id, order_number, days_since_prior_order) %>%
    group_by(user_id) %>%
    summarise(total = max(order_number), 
              frequency = mean(days_since_prior_order, na.rm = TRUE))

user_freq<- sample_n(user_freq,1000)
glimpse(user_freq)

library(plyr)


set.seed(42)
clus <- kmeans(user_freq[,2:3], 4)
clus$cluster <- as.factor(clus$cluster)
clus$cluster<- mapvalues(clus$cluster, from = c("1","2","3","4"), to = c("Buy twice a week",  "Buy almost monthly", "Buy almost weekly", "Buy almost every 2 weeks"))
(clus$centers)
cluster_mba<- ggplot(user_freq,
       aes(total, frequency, color = clus$cluster)) +
    geom_point() + labs(fill = "Frequency of re-buying")

print(cluster_mba)


#SRS used to create a data sample

#library(factoextra)
#library(NbClust)
#(optCluster)

#sampleclus<- sample_n(user_freq[,2:3], 100)

#Check the optimal number of clusters: 

#NbClust(data = sampleclus, diss = NULL, distance = "euclidean", min.nc = 2, max.nc = 15, method = "kmeans")
#fviz_nbclust(sampleclus, kmeans, method = c("silhouette", "wss", "gap_stat"))
#optCluster(as.data.frame(sampleclus), nClust = 4)


#Suggested no. of clusters = 2

##Choosing only wss method gives an answer of 4 clusters (the point where the change of slope is sharply smaller comparing to previous point with smaller amount of clusters)

##Clusters formed: Buy twice a week (1), Buy almost monthly (2), Buy almost weekly (3), Buy almost every two weeks (4)
