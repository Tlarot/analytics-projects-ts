The list of cases are not complete here due one of the reason:
1) The case is old and not reproducible
2) The case cannot be published due to not-defended-yet diploma
3) NDA

For the same reasons, some cases are published partially, and the data for them is not publically available.

In the majority of cases, there is a .html output file created in the folder. 
It is done for the ease of checking the code: each .html contains code chunks included as well as ouput,
so there is no need to install RStudio.
